The Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) approach, which required just 8 iterations, outperformed the other iterative approaches for solving linear problems in this comparison,
requiring 9 iterations from the Gauss-Seidel method and 13 iterations from the Jacobi method.
The Jacobi technique frequently results in slower convergence since it updates every element of the solution vector simultaneously. 
The Gauss-Seidel approach, in contrast, updates the solution vector components one after the other and typically converges more quickly than the Jacobi technique.
This particular scenario illustrates how the SOR method, which is essentially a relaxation factor-enhanced variant of Gauss-Seidel,
usually converges more quickly than both Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.
